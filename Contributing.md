# Contributing to Percentage Utilities

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

This library of custom Excel LAMBDA functions is designed for clarity, precision, and utility. It began as a personal development and teaching tool and is being shared with the hope that others find it equally empowering.

## ðŸ§­ Contribution Guidelines

At present, the project is not accepting external pull requests.  
However, if you have suggestions, bug reports, or requests:

- **Open an issue** using the GitHub Issues tab
- **Tag suggestions clearly** (e.g., `[Request]`, `[Bug]`, `[Discussion]`)
- **Include examples** of expected behavior or input/output if possible

All functions aim to follow these principles:

- Clear naming conventions (`PCT_`, `MATH_`, `DATE_`, etc.)
- Robust handling of optional arguments
- Descriptive documentation blocks for every function
- Elegant and minimal logic that doesnâ€™t sacrifice clarity

As the project expands (e.g., `Math_Utilities`, `Geometry_Utils`, `DateTime_Utilities`, etc.), contributors may be welcomed via invitation.

For now, feel free to fork, adapt, or use any part of this repo in your own projects.

Together, weâ€™re building Excel tools that are smart, elegant, and joyful to use.
