# üî≠ Astronomy LAMBDA Suite for Excel

This suite offers a rich collection of parameter-driven Excel LAMBDA functions tailored for astrophysical modeling, exoplanet metrics, orbital mechanics, and celestial classification. Built for dynamic array compatibility and composability, these tools support everything from habitability analysis to spectral classification and synodic calculations.

---

## üìò Overview

Each function is self-contained and documented with parameters, expected outputs, return types, and usage examples. Designed for pedagogical, speculative, or modeling scenarios, these tools can be combined into custom spreadsheets for interactive exploration of astronomical concepts.

## üß© Highlights and Tips

- üåé **Habitability Modeling**: Use `ASTRO_HAB_INDEX` with `ASTRO_HABITABLE_ZONES` to evaluate planet positions dynamically.
- üî• **Stellar Profiles**: Derive mass, radius, luminosity, and lifetime using `ASTRO_STAR_ATTRIBUTES` from just temperature or mass.
- üåÄ **Orbital Mechanics**: Solve for any two-body orbital attribute (`axis`, `mass`, `period`) using intuitive wrappers or the unified solver.
- üåà **Spectral Tools**: Visualize or convert stellar classifications with `ASTRO_DISPLAY_SPECTRAL`, `ASTRO_CALC_TEMP`, and `ASTRO_TYPE_FROM_TEMP`.
- ü™ê **Planet Design**: Generate plausible planetary profiles using `ASTRO_PLANET_METRICS` from gravity/density, mass/radius, etc.
- ‚è≥ **Synodic Calculations**: Get conjunction intervals or estimate missing sidereal periods via `ASTRO_SYNODIC_SOLVER` or its wrappers.
- üó∫Ô∏è **Coordinate Conversion**: Spherical/Cartesian mapping is supported for 3D modeling or plotting simulations.
- üìè **Angle Tools**: Seamless conversions between degrees and DMS for all observation-based workflows.
