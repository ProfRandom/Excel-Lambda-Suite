# STR_ String Utilities Suite

A robust set of Excel LAMBDA functions designed for string manipulation, character filtering, and lightweight text parsing. These utilities are essential for cleaning input, analyzing character composition, and building custom transformation pipelines inside spreadsheets.

> See `str_utilities.txt` for the full implementation, notes, and examples.

## ðŸ“˜ Usage Notes

- All functions are Excel-native and use `LAMBDA` syntax; compatible with dynamic arrays and `LET`.
- Fallback values like `"#NONE!"` can be overridden in most extraction functions.
- Functions like `STR_FILTERCHARS` and `STR_UNIQUECHARS` include case handling, ASCII evaluation, or mode selectors.
- Designed to complement each otherâ€”e.g., `STR_SANITIZE` â†’ `STR_GETCHARS` â†’ `STR_UNIQUECHARS` is a useful pipeline.
