# 🎲 Randomizer LAMBDA Suite for Excel

This suite provides Excel LAMBDA functions for generating random numbers, random strings, controlled random character mixes, and reproducible seeded randomization. These tools are useful for test data generation, simulations, password creation, sampling, and any spreadsheet model requiring randomness with fine-tuned control.

---

## 📘 Overview

The suite includes numeric, alphanumeric, symbol-inclusive, and reproducible randomization options. Functions support length control, seed-driven deterministic output, and non-repeating unique lists, fully integrated with Excel's dynamic array capabilities.

## 📑 Function Index

| Function | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| `RND_DIGITS` | Generates a random whole number with a specified number of digits. |
| `RND_MIX` | Generates a random string containing a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. |
| `RND_STR` | Generates a random string using only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers). |
| `RND_BY_SEED` | Produces reproducible random output based on a seed value (deterministic randomization). |
| `RND_UNIQUE` | Generates a random permutation of distinct items from a list without repetition. |

## 🧩 Highlights and Tips

- 🔢 **Digit Control**: `RND_DIGITS` allows creation of randomized numeric IDs, codes, or test data of any specified length.
- 🔡 **Mixed String Generation**: `RND_MIX` and `RND_STR` support password-like or display-friendly random strings.
- 🎯 **Deterministic Randomization**: `RND_BY_SEED` provides stable, reproducible random outputs ideal for simulation models or controlled demos.
- 🔁 **Unique Random Sampling**: `RND_UNIQUE` enables random shuffling and non-repeating list generation for sampling exercises or randomized trials.
- 🔐 **Secure Testing**: Useful for random credential creation, test data fabrication, or anonymized mock dataset generation.
